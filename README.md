# DAAOS — Domain-Agnostic Autonomous Orchestration System

## Overview

DAAOS (Domain-Agnostic Autonomous Orchestration System) is an experimental multi-agent orchestration framework designed to coordinate autonomous agents through hierarchical communication, event-driven execution, and dynamic task delegation.

The project aims to evolve beyond traditional multi-agent systems by providing a reusable orchestration runtime capable of supporting different domains, workflows, and agent specializations.

---

## Vision

Most multi-agent systems focus on solving a single workflow.

DAAOS focuses on building the orchestration layer itself.

The long-term goal is to create a runtime where:

* Agents can create new agents.
* Agents can delegate tasks autonomously.
* Communication is hierarchical and scalable.
* Workflows emerge from agent interactions.
* The system remains domain agnostic.

---

## Core Concepts

### Agent Hierarchy

Agents are organized as a tree structure.

```text
Boss
│
├── AgentNode1
│   ├── Leaf1
│   ├── Leaf2
│   └── Leaf3
│
├── AgentNode2
│   ├── Leaf4
│   └── Leaf5
│
└── AgentNode3
```

Each agent may:

* Receive tasks
* Create child agents
* Delegate work
* Communicate with siblings and parents

---

### Event-Driven Communication

Agents communicate through events instead of direct function calls.

Examples:

* TASK_CREATED
* TASK_COMPLETED
* STATUS_UPDATE
* AGENT_SPAWNED

This enables loose coupling and scalable orchestration.

---

### Hierarchical Routing

Communication should remain local whenever possible.

Instead of:

```text
Leaf1 → Boss → Leaf2
```

DAAOS prefers:

```text
Leaf1 → Local Router → Leaf2
```

This reduces communication overhead and improves scalability.

---

### Scheduler-Based Execution

Tasks are managed by a Scheduler rather than directly by the Boss agent.

```text
Boss
 ↓
Scheduler
 ↓
Agents
```

This separation enables future support for:

* dependency management
* workflow orchestration
* parallel execution
* autonomous scheduling

---

## Status

DAAOS is currently an active research and development project.

The current implementation focuses on establishing a robust orchestration runtime before introducing advanced planning, dependency resolution, and autonomous workflow generation.

## Inspiration

DAAOS draws ideas from:

* Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
* Actor Model Architectures
* Event-Driven Systems
* Workflow Orchestration Engines
* Distributed Systems
* Autonomous Agent Frameworks
